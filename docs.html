      <h1><sup>00</sup> Intro</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The responsive redesign was a project spanning a few weeks, which
          involved redesigning a preexisting webpage to adhere more closely to
          both design principles and accessibility guidelines. During this
          timeline, I worked on designing lofi and hifi wireframes, creating a
          style guide, and developing the page with HTML and CSS.

      <h1><sup>01</sup> Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For this project, I chose the website for
          <a href="https://en.tp-tea.com/" target="_blank">TP TEA</a>, which is
          my favorite boba store back at home; even though the user interface is
          already pretty well-developed, I think it would be an interesting
          challenge to further improve the webpage, particularly in bringing a
          more technical and user-driven focus to a website that currently seems
          to be more storytelling and aesthetic-driven.

          <div>
            <h2><sup>01</sup> Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
              One issue with efficiency comes from the interactive components,
              primarily the navigation bar. Upon entering the site, the bar is
              hidden and doesn’t appear until the user starts scrolling, which
              can be inefficient given the convention to either have the
              navigation already displayed or to have it display on hovering
              near the top of the site.
              <br /><br />
              Even if frequent users know they must scroll down to access the
              navigation bar, doing so still costs extra time, which can slow
              them down when they are trying to access other parts of the site.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2><sup>02</sup> Learnability</h2>
            <p>
              The biggest issue with learnability in this website comes from the
              language barrier, given that some elements (like the pop-up in the
              bottom left corner) are still written in Chinese despite being on
              the English version of the site.
              <br /><br />
              Some animations and transitions on the homepage are inconsistent
              as the user goes down the page, with some elements transitioning
              after others in the same group have already loaded. With this
              inconsistency, it becomes difficult to know when to wait for
              things to load and when to know everything has already been
              displayed, which can lead to a less smooth user experience.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2><sup>03</sup> Memorability</h2>
            <p>
              The homepage of the website is pretty long since it contains an
              overview of each section, which can also slow users down if
              they’re trying to get to a specific area of the site via the
              sections on the homepage; to do so, they must read through each
              section to figure out where the button to their desired
              destination is located, especially because the placement of
              buttons is often inconsistent.
              <br /><br />
              As a casual user, it might be easy to remember that links to the
              other pages of the site can all be found on the homepage, yet
              difficult to remember where those links are placed.

      <h1><sup>03</sup> Accessibility</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Using WebAIM WAVE, a few recurring problems with the website surfaced
          as errors: there were three images missing alternative text, seven
          empty links, and three broken ARIA references. In addition to these 14
          errors were a host of 42 alerts, which included problems with
          redundant links or title text, skipped header levels, justified text,
          and suspicious link text.

          <br /><br />

          Although I agree with some of the issues, like missing alt text, empty
          links, and justified text, I didn’t agree with other alerts concerning
          redundant links/title text and skipped header levels. For redundant
          links/title text, it seemed like WebAIM WAVE was mostly focused on
          individual words rather than the entire text itself. Additionally, for
          skipped header levels, I didn’t feel that it was always necessary to
          go in order, since having three header levels like an H1, H2, and H3
          can impede visual hierarchy given their similarities in size.

      <h1><sup>04</sup> Speed Sketching</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For my sketches, I focused on both the structure of the page and on
          working through sections where I felt visual hierarchy was a bit more
          disorganized.

          The final sketch combined a few elements from the initial sketches,
          with a simplified page structure and modular components. Although it
          stayed pretty loyal to the original site, it also reorganized the
          information in a way that was more consistent and readable.

          The only issues that surfaced in WebAIM were ones concerning
          repetitive alt text, but I wanted to keep the content of the alt text
          related to the drinks featured in the Menu section; however, given
          that all of these are drinks (many of them milk teas), WebAIM likely
          found issue with the duplicate labels.

        <p>
          Overall, it was a pretty fun experience redesigning and coding a
          website that I was somewhat familiar with before. Even though I have
          had a decent amount of frontend and UI/UX experience, I still felt
          like I was able to learn some more CSS techniques that I hadn't known
          before, and seeing this website through a more accessibility-focused
          lens rather than one that was more graphic design-focused was also
          interesting as well.
